# EmployeeManagement Component Fixes

## Tasks
- [x] Remove duplicate and malformed updateSelectedEmployee function (No duplicate found - function is properly implemented)
- [x] Move loading check to proper position at component return start (Already in correct position)
- [x] Implement EditModal component for editing employee details (Already fully implemented)
- [x] Verify component structure and exports (Component structure is correct and properly exported)
