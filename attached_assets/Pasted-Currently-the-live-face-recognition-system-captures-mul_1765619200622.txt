Currently, the live face recognition system captures multiple short videos (4 separate recordings) for different face poses, which results in poor accuracy and user experience.
I want to redesign this system to use a single continuous live video recording for both face registration and face verification, with high accuracy and reliability.

Requirements

Single Continuous Video Capture

Recording should start once and stop once (one complete video).

During recording, the system must automatically capture and analyze all required face poses (front, left, right, up, down) without requiring separate recordings.

No manual pose selection by the user.

High-Accuracy Face Registration

While recording, extract multiple high-quality face frames from the video.

Ensure:

Proper lighting

Face fully visible

No blur or occlusion

Generate and store robust face embeddings/descriptors using a reliable face recognition model.

Reject registration if face quality, confidence score, or liveness check fails.

Live Face Verification (Liveness + Identity)

During attendance marking, employee must verify identity using live video face recognition.

System must:

Confirm the face matches the registered embeddings

Perform liveness detection to prevent photo/video spoofing

Ensure real-time confidence score crosses a defined threshold

Verification must fail if:

Face mismatch

Liveness detection fails

Video quality is insufficient

Attendance Security Enforcement

Attendance must NOT be marked unless:

Face recognition is successful

Liveness detection passes

Confidence score meets the required accuracy level

No fallback, no manual override.

Accuracy & Performance Goals

Recognition should be:

Highly accurate

Pose-invariant

Lighting-tolerant

Fast and stable on real-world devices

Minimize false positives and false negatives.

System should work reliably in real-time production environments.

User Experience

Simple workflow:

Click “Start Recording”

Record once

Click “Stop”

System handles everything automatically

Clear error messages and retry instructions if verification fails.
