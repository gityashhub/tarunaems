Feature Enhancement: Task Management Extension & Simplification
1. Department Access Update

Currently, the Tasks section is available only for the Designing and Development departments. This functionality must be extended to the BDE (Business Development Executive) department.

The BDE department panel should include the following sections:

Dashboard

Attendance

Leave Requests

Sales

Tasks

The Tasks section for BDE must behave consistently with existing department implementations in terms of navigation, permissions, and UI/UX.

2. Admin Task Management – Form Simplification

The existing “Add Task” button for admin users must:

Remain in the same location

Retain its current behavior (on click)

When clicked, it should open a “Create New Task” form containing only the following fields:

Required Fields

Description – text input

Assign To – dropdown for employee selection

Previously limited to employees in the Development department

Now must list all employees across all departments

Priority – selectable priority levels

Due Date – date picker in dd-mm-yyyy format

Estimated Hours – numeric input

3. Fields to Be Removed

The following fields must be completely removed from the task creation form and related logic:

Title

Project

Select Project

Category

4. Implementation Requirements

UI/UX Consistency

Ensure the BDE Tasks section visually and functionally matches existing department task sections.

Validation & Functionality

All existing validation rules and business logic for the remaining fields must remain intact.

Database Updates

Update the task schema to reflect the simplified structure.

Ensure data integrity and compatibility with existing task records.

API Modifications

Update all task-related APIs (create, update, fetch) to support the simplified payload structure.

Ensure existing tasks continue to function without errors.

Testing & Verification
Implement thorough testing to validate:

Department-specific access to the Tasks section (including BDE)

Form validation behavior

Correct data storage and retrieval

Backward compatibility with previously created tasks
