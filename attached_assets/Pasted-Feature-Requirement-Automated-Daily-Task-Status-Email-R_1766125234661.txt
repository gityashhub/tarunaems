Feature Requirement: Automated Daily Task Status Email Report

Currently, the admin can assign tasks to employees using the Task Management module.
This feature must now be extended to include automated daily task status email reporting.

1. Email Scheduling (IST)

An automated email must be sent daily in IST at the following times:

12:05 PM

12:10 PM

12:15 PM

At each scheduled time, the email must reflect the current (real-time) status of all tasks assigned to employees at that moment.

2. Email Recipient

All task status report emails must be sent to:

tarunatechnology@gmail.com

3. Email Sender (IMPORTANT – Configurable Admin Email)

Emails must be technically sent using a single admin/system email address, which must be configurable (via environment variable or config).

This admin/system email will be used for SMTP authentication and will own the app password.

Example (configurable):

ADMIN_SYSTEM_EMAIL=ypank14@gmail.com
ask for app password from user.


Each email must be sent on behalf of the employee whose tasks are being reported:

The visible “From” name and email must be the employee’s registered email address

The Reply-To address must also be the employee’s registered email

Note: Employee email accounts must not be used for SMTP authentication and must not require app passwords.

4. Email Content Requirements

Each email must include complete task details exactly as shown in the Tasks section of the employee panel at the time of sending.

Employee Information

Employee Name

Employee Department

Employee Email ID

Task Details (for all tasks assigned to that employee)

Task Description

Task Status (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed)

Priority

Due Date

Estimated Hours

Any other task-related fields currently visible in the employee task details view

The email content must accurately reflect the real-time task data at the scheduled send time.

5. Implementation Requirements

Use a reliable scheduler / cron job aligned explicitly with the IST timezone.

Capture accurate task status snapshots at each scheduled time.

Handle multiple employees, each with multiple tasks, correctly.

Send separate emails per employee, each representing only that employee’s tasks.

Prevent duplicate or missed emails for any scheduled execution.

Implement robust logging and error handling for:

Email delivery failures

Scheduler execution errors

6. Technical Constraints (Explicit)

Only one admin/system email account must be used for SMTP authentication.

Employee email credentials must never be stored or used.

Email sending must follow the “send on behalf of employee” pattern.
